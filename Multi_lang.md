  * The language in hardcoded into each files, you need to search each strings and replace it by the corresponding table key
  * The table'll look like this :
```

language = {}
language.french = {
say_hello = [[Bonjour]],
name_exp = [[experience]]
}
mainlangage = langage[GM.Config.lang]

```
_The table keys must read the action and not the sortcut of the message_
